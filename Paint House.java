/*
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

 Notice

All costs are positive integers.

Example
Given costs = [[14,2,11],[11,14,5],[14,3,10]] return 10

house 0 is blue, house 1 is green, house 2 is blue, 2 + 5 + 3 = 10

        dp[0][2] = costs[0][2];

            dp[i][1] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][2]) + costs[i][1];
            dp[i][2] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]) + costs[i][2];
